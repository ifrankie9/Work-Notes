- [x] Reviewing ISYE6501 HW2  Question 6
  - CUSUM can be used to monitor the number of cases, and detect a change when the number of cases rises above a threshold, indicating a possible outbreak.
  - Ideallly, the CUSUM statistic St should remain smaller than the threshold if an epidemic is not going to occur, and quickly cross the threshold if an epidemic is going to occur.
  - Typical choice of threshold T is standard deviations, which C will be half of a standard deviation.

# -------------------------- CUSUM function -------------------------------------
# We can create a cusum chart for each year and note when the temperautes changes from summer to fall
# We can use the se.shift parameter to indicate the threshold in terms of the std.dev parameter
# We can use the decision.interval parameter to indicate the C value in terms of std.dev parameter 

#Creates a data object/frame to store all our cusum models together for easy reference
CUSUMmodels <- vector(mode="list", length=nrow(temps)) 
CUSUMviolations <- vector(mode="list", length=nrow(temps)) 

# Loop through each year and run the CUSUM function
# center is the "target" summer temperature each year
# std.dev is the standard deviation of the summer temperature each year
# We set se.shift as the amount of shift to detect (which corresponds to 2*C in terms of standard deviations/errors)
# We set decision.interval as the upper and lower bound in standard deviations/errors from 0 change
DI = 5 #out of control when past 5 standard deviations/errors
SS = 6 #equals 6/2 = 3 standard deviations/errors shift
for (i in 1:nrow(temps)){
  CUSUMmodels[[i]] <- cusum(temps[[i]], center=avg_summer[i], std.dev = sd_summer[i], decision.interval=DI, se.shift=SS, plot = TRUE)
  CUSUMviolations[[i]] <- CUSUMmodels[[i]]$violations$lower
}

#We are concerned with the lower violations since we want to catch significant drops in temperature that indicate transfer 
#from summer to fall. For simplicity, I'll take the minimum of each list of lower violations
CUSUMlowest <- rep(0, nrow(temps))
CUSUMlowesttemp <- rep(0, nrow(temps))
for (i in 1:nrow(temps)){
  CUSUMlowest[i] <- min(CUSUMviolations[[i]])
  CUSUMlowesttemp[i] <- as.integer(mean(temps[[i]][1:CUSUMlowest[i]]))
}

#CUSUMlowest and CUSUMlowesttemp store the index of the lower violation in the CUSUM analysis for each year
#and the average temperatures up to that day associated with that index.
#These two vectors contain the unofficial end of summer day number and summer climate 
#(average summer temperature up to the day of change)

#From the plot, we can see an expected trend of a decrease in temperature as the day number get larger
#I.e. as we get farther into fall, the average temperature tends to drop
plot(CUSUMlowest,CUSUMlowesttemp)
