  ### Probability-Based Models (M & C) 
  #### Queuing 
    1. Time between arrivals, Probability distribution that describes how often someone answers the phone.      Poisson(lambda)
    2. Phone taking times, Call leaves the system after finished based on another probability distribution.     Exponential(mu)
    3. Calculate: 
        1.	Expected fraction of time employee is busy = lambda/mu
        2.	Expected waiting time before talking to employee = lambda / mu(lambda-mu)
        3.	Expected number of calls waiting in queue = lambda2/ mu(lambda-mu)
   #### The memoryless  概率, 与历史记录或经验无关
   probability means that it doesn't matter what's happened in the past, all that matters is where we are now. 
   
   In the exponential distribution, it doesn't matter how long an employee has been on the phone. The distribution of the remaining call time is exactly the same. That's purely a property of the exponential distribution. It's not something we need to know beforehand about phone calls. *It's something we can discover, by finding the call time distribution*. If the distribution of phone call times fits the exponential distribution? Then it means we've discovered something about phone call time, it's memoryless. 
The Poisson distribution is also memoryless, because it's related to the exponential distribution, as we saw in a previous lesson. So if we find that the arrivals of calls to the queue fit a Poisson distribution, we know they're memoryless.
   #### Type of Simulation
     1.	Deterministic simulations never vary, given the same inputs, the outputs will always be the same. There's no randomness in the system.
     2.	In stochastic simulations, we might get different output each time we run a model, because the system includes some randomness that we've modeled.
   #### Arena Simulation Software, Elements of model include:
     -	Entities: things that move through simulations (e.g. bags, people, etc.)
     -	Modules: parts of process (e.g. queues, storage. etc.)
     -	Actions
     -	Resources (e.g. workers)
     -	Decision points
     -	Statistical tracking
   #### Simulation Note:
     -	One replication = one data point (may be unrepresenttative)
     -	Run multiple times to get distribution of outcomes
   #### Prescriptive Simulation
   We can run the simulation with different options and compare the results to see what the best course of action is. Some simulation software even has the ability to do some heuristic optimization of a set of parameters.

   Simulation is only as good as the quality of the input. If there's missing information or an incorrect assumption, the simulation might give the wrong answers.
   ##### Example
   Simulation be used in a prescriptive analytics way, for example to determine the right number of voting machines and poll workers at an election location?
     -	Vary parameters of interest (like the number of voting machines and the number of poll workers), compare the simulated system performance, and select the setup with the best results (for example, the best balance between low waiting times to vote and low cost of machines and workers).

     -	Use the automated optimization function in simulation software (for example, OptQuest in Arena) to find parameter values that give good results.
   #### Markov Chains 
   Probability based analytics model that can be used for making comparison.
   
   For each state i in the Markov chain model, we know the probability that at the next step the system will be in state j. That probability pij is called the transition probability. For visualization we can put all of the transition probabilities pij into a transition matrix P.
   
   We can just imagine a time called steady state, where the states have gotten so mixed that the initial conditions no longer matter. In steady state, the probability of being in state i is the same every day. So if we apply the transition matrix by multiplying pi by P, we'll get our vector pi back again. The probabilities are the same.
   
   A key assumption of Markov chains is that they're memoryless. It doesn't matter what the previous states were. The only thing that matters is what state we're in now.
   ### Missing Data (C) 
   #### Dealing with missing data
     - Throw away
     - Use categorical variables to indicate missing data
       - Add category variable: missing
       - All missing data: 0
       - include interactions variables between the categorical variable and other variables
     - Estimate missing values
