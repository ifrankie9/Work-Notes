   ###  Advanced Models (M)  
   #### Non-Parametric Methods (all we have is responses and we don't have a good model for distribution/not enough data/know median)
     - <b>McNemar's Test</b>
       - Compare results on pairs of response
       - Use the binomial distribution to calculate p-value
       - Data type: Yes/No
     - <b>Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for Medians</b>
       - Assumptions: Distribution is continuous and symmetric
       - If the probability p of getting a sum of ranks at least as extreme as W is small, then we can say that the median is probably different from m.
       - Data type: Numeric
       - Given response y1,...,yn
           1. Rank |y1-m|,...|yn-m|from smallest to largest
           2. *W*=(yi>m)∑rank(yi-m)=sum of all ranks where yi>m, signed rank is like a normal distribution
           3. p-value test for *W*
    - <b>Mann-Whitney Test</b>
      - Two data sets, but not paired samples
      - Given independent observations y1,...,yn and z1,...,zm
          1. Rank all observations together, y1,...,yn and z1,...,zm
          2. *U*=smaller of two adjusted rank sums: *U*=min{Uy,Uz}, Uy=n∑(i=1)rank(yi)-n(n+1)/2, Uz=m∑(j=1)rank(zi)-m(m+1)/2
          3. Find significance of *U* (need software or table)
    - <b>Summary</b>:
      - Nonparametric tests
        - Use even when nothing is known about underlying distribution
      - Two data sets
        - McNemar's test (paired yes/no)
        - Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired numeric data)
        - Mann-Whitney (unpaired)
      - One data set
        - Wilcoxon signed rank test (compare possible median)
   #### Bayesian Modeling
     - Empirical Bayes Modeling
       - Overall distribution of something is known or estimated, but Only a little data available
       - Even a single observarion / combined with broader set of observation can make a distribution or prediction 
   #### Communities in Graphs
     - Focus on automated ways of finding highly-interconnected subpopulations
     - Louvain Algorithm (decomposing a graph into communities, maximize modularity of a graph)
       - aij, weight on the arc between nodes i and j, or 0
       - wi, total weigth of arcs connected to i
       - W, total weight of all the arcs
