   ### Missing Data (C) 
   #### Dealing with missing data
     - Throw away
     - Use categorical variables to indicate missing data
       - Add category variable: missing
       - All missing data: 0
       - include interactions variables between the categorical variable and other variables
     - Estimate missing values
   #### Imputation Methods: estimate the missing data (trade off, simplicity, realism)
     - Midrange value (mean, median[numeric] or mode[categorical])
       - Advantage: hedge against being too wrong, easy to compute
       - Disadvantage: Biased imputation
     - Regression: reduce or eliminate the problem of bias
       - Disadvantage: Complex(build, fit, validate, test to estimate missing data), does not capture all the variability
     - Impute with added variability (Add perturbation 扰动 to each imputed value)
       - No perturbation: More accurate on average, less accurate variability
       - Perturbation distributed: Less accurate on average, more accurate variability
     - Notes: 1. Limit the amount of imputation you do, no more than 5% per factor
   #### Optimization for predictive analytics
     - Used for: descriptive描述性 / predictive预测性 / prescriptive规定性 analytics
     - Notes: Statistical software can both build and solve regression models. Optimization software only solves models; human experts are required to build optimization models
     - Optimization Models:
       - Three main components: 
         - Variables : decisions to made - find best combinations of variables
         - Constraints: restrictions on variable values 
         - Objective function: solution quality measure
         ***
         - Solution: values for each variable
         - Feasible solution: variable values that satisfy all constraints
         - Optimal solution: feasible solution with the best objective value
       - In order to use the optimization model, we first need to use statistical methods, like regression, to find the right values of alpha and beta, to determine the relationship between time and votes, etc.
