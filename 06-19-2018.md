  - **Bernouli Distribution**
    - P(X=1)=p, P(X=1)=1-p
    - Example: Ask 1/12 of the list to donate. For each person, followed Bernouli Distribution(Donate or not). The total of each month's total donation follows the Binomial Distribution. 
  - **Binomial Distribution**
    - Getting X success out of N *independent identically* distributed Bernouli trails.
    - P(X=x)=(n!/((n-x)!x!)) * p[cap x] * (1-p)[cap n-x]
    - When n gets large, Binomial --> Normal Distribution
  - **Geometric Distribution**
    - Probability of having X Bernouli failures until first success?/ How many trails till happen?   Or reverse direstion.
    - P(X=x)= (1-p)[cap x] * p, p is the propability of success
  - **Possion Distribution**
    - f(x) = λ[cap x] * e[cap -λ] / x!, x is real number, λ is average number, f(x) is probability of event
  - **Exponential Distribution**
    - f(x) = λ * e[cap -λx], x is real number, λ is average number, f(x) is probability of event
    - 如果*独立随机事件*发生服从*Possion Distribution*，则发生*时间间隔*服从*Exponential Distribution*， 反之亦然
  - **Weibull Distribution**
    - f(x) = (k / λ) * (x / λ)[cap k-1] * e[cap -(x/λ)[cap k]], λ is scale parameter, x is shape parameter
    - k<1, 用于failure rate decrease with time的模型建立 (最坏的事件最先发生)
    - k>1, 用于failure rate increase with time的模型建立 (最好的事件先发生，后期坏的速度越来越快)
    - k<1, 用于failure rate is constant with time的模型建立 (不随时间改变失败速率=*Exponential Distribution*)
  - Q-Q Plots
    - Visualizing
      - whether two distributions of data about the same
      - whether data is distributed to a probability distribution
    - X axis (Sample 1 quantiles), Y axis (Sample 2 quantiles), if data fit perfectly the 45 degress line, we can tell these two samples have similar data, otherwise may have trail heavy condition.
- [x] Play [SQL](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT201x+1T2018a/progress)
  - Played Lab 2 and 3, will put all in file and update later
